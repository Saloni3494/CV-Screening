# **Product Requirements Document: CV Screening App MVP**
**Version:** 1.0 (Candidate-Centric)

---

### **1. Introduction & Problem Statement**
The modern job search is highly competitive. Candidates often send out dozens, if not hundreds, of applications without receiving a response. It's difficult to know why a resume was rejected or how to improve it for the next application. Job seekers struggle to understand if they are a good fit for a role and, more importantly, what specific skills they are missing to become a top contender.

The AI Job Match & Skill Gap Analyzer is a personal career tool designed to empower job seekers. By comparing their resume against a specific job description, it provides instant, actionable feedback, highlighting their strengths and pinpointing the exact skills they need to develop or showcase.

### **2. User Persona**
**Name:** Alex, the Aspiring Data Analyst
**Role:** A recent graduate or early-career professional looking to land a job in data analytics.

**Goals:**
* Stop "spraying and praying"â€”only apply to jobs where they are a strong fit.
* Understand exactly what skills are required for a dream job.
* Get more interviews by tailoring their resume effectively.
* Create a learning plan based on real-time market demands.

**Pain Points:**
* "I apply to 20 jobs a day and never hear back. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."
* "The job description lists so many 'required skills.' Which ones are actually important?"
* "I want to improve my skills, but I don't know what I should learn next to be more marketable."

### **3. Goals & Objectives**
The primary goal of the MVP is to provide a user with clear, actionable insights on how their resume stacks up against a single job description.

* **User Goal:** To instantly see their match percentage for a job and get a simple list of the key skills they are missing.
* **Project Goal:** To build a portfolio piece that demonstrates practical NLP skills by solving a tangible, painful problem for job seekers.
* **Technical Goal:** To accurately parse resume and job description text, identify key skills/keywords, and reliably differentiate between matched and missing skills.

### **4. Features & Scope (MVP)**
The MVP will be a focused tool that executes one core workflow brilliantly.

| Feature ID | Feature Name          | Description                                                                                                                   | Priority      |
| :--------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **F-01** | Resume Uploader       | The user can upload their resume. The system will support `.pdf` and `.docx` formats.                                         | **Must-Have** |
| **F-02** | Job Description Input | The user can paste the full text of a job description into a text area.                                                       | **Must-Have** |
| **F-03** | Analysis Trigger      | A single button (e.g., "Analyze My Match") that initiates the comparison.                                                     | **Must-Have** |
| **F-04** | Overall Match Score   | After processing, the system displays a clear, quantitative match score (e.g., "You are a 75% match for this role").           | **Must-Have** |
| **F-05** | Skill Gap Analysis    | (Core Feature) The system displays a prominent list of important skills and keywords found in the job description that are missing from the user's resume. | **Must-Have** |
| **F-06** | Matched Skills Display| To provide positive feedback, the system also displays a list of required skills that were found in the user's resume.        | **High** |

### **5. User Flow & Design**
The user journey is designed to be simple and provide immediate value.

1.  **Start:** The user lands on a clean page with two elements: a file upload control and a text area.
2.  **Input:** The user uploads their resume and pastes the target job description.
3.  **Action:** The user clicks "Analyze My Match." A loading animation provides feedback that the system is working.
4.  **Results:** The page updates to show a results dashboard:
    * At the top: The **Overall Match Score**.
    * Below the score, two distinct sections:
        * A "call-to-action" section titled "**Skills to Add or Learn**" (the skill gap).
        * A "confirmation" section titled "**Your Matching Skills**".

### **6. Success Metrics**
We will measure the success of the MVP by its ability to provide actionable advice.

* **Actionability Score:** After a user sees their results, ask a simple, one-click question: "Was this analysis helpful for improving your resume?" (Yes/No). The goal is a >80% "Yes" rate.
* **Clarity of Feedback:** Qualitative feedback from test users on whether the "missing skills" list was clear, relevant, and accurate.
* **Processing Time:** Target time from click to results should be under 15 seconds to maintain user engagement.

### **7. Out of Scope for MVP (Future Considerations)**
To ensure the MVP is lean and focused, the following features will not be included in the initial release:

* Recommending other jobs based on the user's resume.
* Automatically suggesting how to rephrase sentences in the resume.
* Providing links to online courses or resources for the missing skills.
* User accounts for saving history or multiple resumes.
