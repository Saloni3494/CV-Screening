# CV-Screening
<br>

A candidate-centric tool that empowers job seekers by analyzing their resume against specific job descriptions, providing instant, actionable feedback on strengths and skill gaps.


🎯 The Problem
The modern job search is highly competitive. Candidates often send out hundreds of applications without receiving a response, struggling to understand why their resume was rejected or how to improve it. This tool solves that problem by providing clear, data-driven insights into job fit and pinpointing specific missing skills, turning rejection into an opportunity for growth.

🖱️ One-Click Analysis: A single "Analyze My Match" button initiates the entire process.
