🎯 The Problem
The modern job search is highly competitive. Candidates often send out hundreds of applications without receiving a response, struggling to understand why their resume was rejected or how to improve it. This tool solves that problem by providing clear, data-driven insights into job fit and pinpointing specific missing skills, turning rejection into an opportunity for growth.

✨ Key Features

📄 Resume Upload: Supports both .pdf and .docx formats.

✍️ Job Description Input: Paste any job description directly into the app for analysis.

🖱️ One-Click Analysis: A single "Analyze My Match" button initiates the entire process.

📊 Overall Match Score: Get a clear, percentage-based compatibility score to quickly gauge your fit.

💡 Skill Gap Analysis: The core feature! See a list of important skills from the job description that are missing from your resume.

✅ Matched Skills Display: Get positive reinforcement by seeing which required skills you already possess.

🚀 How It Works
The user flow is designed to be as simple as possible:

Upload: Upload your current resume.

Input: Paste the full job description for the role you're targeting.
